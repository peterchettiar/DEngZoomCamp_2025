# Introduction to Batch Processing

**Batch processing** is a computational technique in which a collection of data is amassed and then processed in a single operation, often without the need for real-time interaction. This approach is a particularly effective method for handling large volumes of data, where tasks can be executed as a group during off-peak hours to optimmize system resources and throughput. End-of-day bank reconcilliation and payroll processing is an example of batch processing.

Basic principles - Here are some basic principles of the batch processing method:
