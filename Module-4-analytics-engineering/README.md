# Introduction to Analytics Engineering

## What is Analytics Engineering?

As the _data domain_ has developed over time, new tools have been introduced that have changed the dynamics of working with data:

1. Massively parallel processing (MPP) databases
    * Lower the cost of storage in computing
    * e.g. BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift
1. Data-pipelines-as-a-service
    * Simplify the ETL process
    * e.g. Fivetran, Stitch
1. SQL-first / Version control systems
    * e.g. Looker
1. Self service analytics
    * e.g. Mode
1. Data governance

The introduction of all of these tools changed the way the data teams work as well as the way that the stakeholders consume the data, creating a gap in the roles of the data team. Traditionally:

* The ***data engineer*** prepares and maintains the infrastructure the data team needs.
* The ***data analyst*** uses data to answer questions and solve problems (they are in charge of _today_).
* The ***data scientist*** predicts the future based on past patterns and covers the what-ifs rather than the day-to-day (they are in charge of _tomorrow_).

However, with the introduction of these tools, both data scientists and analysts find themselves writing more code even though they're not software engineers and writing code isn't their top priority.  Data engineers are good software engineers but they don't have the training in how the data is going to be used by the business users.

The ***analytics engineer*** is the role that tries to fill the gap: it introduces the good software engineering practices to the efforts of data analysts and data scientists. The analytics engineer may be exposed to the following tools:
1. Data Loading (Fivetran, Stitch...)
1. Data Storing (Data Warehouses)
1. Data Modeling (dbt, Dataform...)
1. Data Presentation (BI tools like Looker, Mode, Tableau...)

This lesson focuses on the last 2 parts: Data Modeling and Data Presentation.

## Data Modeling Concepts

### ETL vs ELT

In lesson 2 we covered the difference between [ELT and ETL](https://github.com/peterchettiar/DEngZoomCamp_2025/tree/dbt_cloud/Module-2-workflow-orchestration#etl-vs-elt).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba6ad322-b207-40a4-a2cd-18cb6fbe1ab9)

Key difference are summarised in a table as follows:

| **Aspect**             | **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**               | **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)**              |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Order of Operations** | Extract → Transform → Load                      | Extract → Load → Transform                     |
| **Transformation**      | Performed in an intermediary tool               | Performed within the target system             |
| **Data Handling**       | Suited for structured data                      | Handles structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data |
| **Performance**         | Slower for large datasets due to pre-loading transformations | Faster, leveraging modern cloud platforms      |
| **Tools**               | Legacy tools like Informatica, DataStage, SSIS  | Cloud-native tools like Snowflake, Databricks, dbt |
| **Use Cases**           | Traditional data warehouses, strict pre-load transformations | Modern cloud data warehouses, big data processing |
| **Advantages**          | Consistent transformations, good for smaller datasets | Scalability, speed, and simplified workflows   |
| **Disadvantages**       | Slower and more resource-intensive for large data volumes | Requires powerful target systems for transformations |

In this lesson we will cover the _transform_ step in the ELT process.

### Dimensional Modeling

[Ralph Kimball's Dimensional Modeling](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dimensional_modeling#:~:text=Dimensional%20modeling%20(DM)%20is%20part,use%20in%20data%20warehouse%20design.) is an approach to Data Warehouse design which focuses on 2 main points:
* Deliver data which is understandable to the business users.
* Deliver fast query performance.

Other goals such as reducing redundant data (prioritized by other approaches such as [3NF](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Third_normal_form#:~:text=Third%20normal%20form%20(3NF)%20is,integrity%2C%20and%20simplify%20data%20management.) by [Bill Inmon](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bill_Inmon)) are secondary to these goals. Dimensional Modeling also differs from other approaches to Data Warehouse design such as [Data Vaults](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Data_vault_modeling).

Dimensional Modeling is based around 2 important concepts:
* ***Fact Table***:
    * _Facts_ = _Measures_
    * Typically numeric values which can be aggregated, such as measurements or metrics.
        * Examples: sales, orders, etc.
    * Corresponds to a [_business process_ ](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Business_process).
    * Can be thought of as _"verbs"_.
* ***Dimension Table***:
    * _Dimension_ = _Context_
    * Groups of hierarchies and descriptors that define the facts.
        * Example: customer, product, etc.
    * Corresponds to a _business entity_.
    * Can be thought of as _"nouns"_.
* Dimensional Modeling is built on a [***star schema***](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Star_schema) with fact tables surrounded by dimension tables.

A good way to understand the _architecture_ of Dimensional Modeling is by drawing an analogy between dimensional modeling and a restaurant:
* Stage Area:
    * Contains the raw data.
    * Not meant to be exposed to everyone.
    * Similar to the food storage area in a restaurant.
* Processing area:
    * From raw data to data models.
    * Focuses in efficiency and ensuring standards.
    * Similar to the kitchen in a restaurant.
* Presentation area:
    * Final presentation of the data.
    * Exposure to business stakeholder.
    * Similar to the dining room in a restaurant.

# Introduction to dbt

## What is dbt?

***dbt*** stands for ***data build tool***. It's a _transformation_ tool: it allows us to transform process _raw_ data in our Data Warehouse to _transformed_ data which can be later used by Business Intelligence tools and any other data consumers.

A more formal definition would be that dbt is a transformation workflow that allows anyone that knows SQL to deploy analytics code following software engineering best practices like modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f50d3375-0e01-4ec0-b80c-2ee5e916fad1)

dbt also allows us to introduce good software engineering practices by defining a _deployment workflow_:
1. Develop models
1. Test and document models
1. Deploy models with _version control_ and _CI/CD_.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b965eabb-e972-4f98-a683-c39657e7acbb)

## How does dbt work?

dbt works by defining a ***modeling layer*** that sits on top of our Data Warehouse. The modeling layer will turn _tables_ into ***models*** which we will then transform into _derived models_, which can be then stored into the Data Warehouse for persistence.

A ***model*** is a .sql file with a `SELECT` statement; no DDL (Data Definition Language - e.g. `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, etc.) or DML (Data Manipulation Language - e.g. `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, etc.) is used. dbt removes all the complexities and generate the DDL and DML for us. And will `dbt compile` the file as well as `dbt run` it in our Data Warehouse. In simpler terms, in the case of the example model from the lecture, dbt will take two raw table from the staging area and transform them to create either a table or a view to the next layer in the data warehouse.

## How to use dbt?

dbt has 2 main ways of using dbt: _dbt Core_ and _dbt Cloud_:
* ***dbt Core***: open-source project that allows the data transformation.
    * Builds and runs a dbt project (.sql and .yaml files).
    * Includes SQL compilation logic, macros and database adapters.
    * Includes a CLI interface to run dbt commands locally.
    * Open-source and free to use.
* ***dbt Cloud***: SaaS (Software as a service) application to develop and manage dbt projects.
    * Web-based IDE to develop, run and test a dbt project.
    * Jobs orchestration.
    * Logging and alerting.
    * Intregrated documentation.
    * Free for individuals (one developer seat).

For integration with BigQuery we will use the dbt Cloud IDE, so a local installation of dbt core isn't required. For developing locally rather than using the Cloud IDE, dbt Core is required. Using dbt with a local Postgres database can be done with dbt Core, which can be installed locally and connected to Postgres and run models through the CLI.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97115ecb-b736-45c9-82a7-4eca83303915)

# Setting up dbt

Before we begin, go to BigQuery and create 2 new empty datasets for your project: a _development_ dataset and a _production_ dataset. Name them any way you'd like.

> [!NOTE]
> Since I'm using BigQuery, I need to use dbt cloud. Hence I will be following the Alternative A video with some minor changes (i.e. steps for setup that actually worked for me since the video did not really cover most of the setup process). Check out [video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0XCDyKiU64&list=PLaNLNpjZpzwgneiI-Gl8df8GCsPYp_6Bs&index=4).

## dbt Cloud

### 1. Create a BigQuery Service account

- In order to connect BigQuery to our DBT project we need to generate a service account JSON file from  [BigQuery credential wizard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/wizard).
- On the landing page you need to fill out the details as follows before clicking on the `NEXT` button:

￼![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54af621d-f2f6-41ba-974c-1e9958025295)

- Your next page should look something like this:

￼![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e374fb0-e1d4-440d-81b7-f869cd247903)

- Fill out the page as follows :

A. Service account name - dbt-service-account

B. Service account ID - **This would be automatically generated based on the service account name - NO NEED TO FILL**

C. Service account description (OPTIONAL) -  Service account for dbt cloud

- After you click on create and continue, you need to add the roles for the service account

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f685c4fc-f875-4ad5-a1f2-ef45634a4a89)

- Add the following roles:

A. BigQuery Admin

B. BigQuery Data Editor

C. BigQuery Job User

D. BigQuery User

- Once you click on `Done`, you can now proceeds to generate the private key for the service account
- Go to the keys section, select "create new key". Select key type JSON and once you click on create it will get immediately downloaded for you to use. (The JSON key file should be in your downloads folder)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c805591d-55a5-47cc-a522-747b76d82025)

### 2. Create a dbt cloud project

- Now that we have created a service account for [dbt cloud](https://www.getdbt.com/pricing/), we can proceed to the dbt website to create a project (you can create a free account that entails one free project which suitable enough for our learning)
- Your landing page once you’ve logged in should look something like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c506038c-f84a-4b48-abe8-c00e9e23bc1e)

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a default project already created, you can simply click on the project name and click on edit once the project details pop up and press delete in the subsequent landing page

- Click on `New Project` on the top right and this should lead you to the `Set up a new project` page where you are to fill out three things: `Name your project`; `Configure your development environment`; `Setup your repository`
- For the first field `Name your project` you can simply type `taxi_rides_ny` and click continue
- Next for `Configure your development environment`, you would need to add new connection in the connection drop down and it should take you to another page where you have to select biqquery as that is probably what you are using. After giving a connection name (in my case, simply big query), it should look like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c728896-136f-4799-b91a-0491abaad5ce)

- Next click on `Upload a Service account json file` and load the JSON file from the downloads folder (remember this was the key file that we had generated for our service account from GCP)
- It should automatically populate the fields and then click on save at the top right.
- Please make sure to fill in the `Location` field. This is technically an optional field and hence it does not get populated with the `.json` file upload, but it is essestial especially if `BigQuery` default location does not match your source data location. For example, I left this field blank and the location for the dataset for dbt development (in my case was `dbt_pchettiar`) on bigquery was defaulted to `US` but my source data location was `asia-southeast1`. This naturally raised errors like `not found: Dataset`. Hence, it's recommended to create this schema manually to avoid multiregion errors.
- Now that we have created our connection, this should be reflected on the project setup page as well. Simply click on it and test connection (this should be successful), after which you click on save.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c84cf112-9e6a-4274-9fec-6f5f3ef7ca8d)

> [!NOTE]
> There will be a few fields that would be automatically filled at the stage where you have to test connection (Dataset, Target Name and Threads), please note that when you make your first `dbt run` on your cloud IDE, the dataset name should appear in BigQuery which should be indicating that the connection to BigQuery from dbt was successful, and that the dataset is a sandbox dataset for development.

- Set up a repository, for this section click on `Git Clone` and add the git URL to our repo (e.g. `git@github.com:peterchettiar/DEngZoomCamp_2025.git`)
- Once you’ve added, deploy keys will be generated. Dbt will use the deploy keys to clone the repository, hence in the next section we will discuss more on how to add the deploy keys in your Github account.

### 3. Connect Github project repo to dbt cloud project

- Go to your project repo and click on settings.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88137b60-6b09-48b1-9216-fd25f404a1fc)

- Next on the settings page, look for `Deploy keys` under security on the left navigation panel

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/956db92d-821b-4883-a4fc-1ec84a347dad)

- Now you can click on add deploy key and add the title and key value from your dbt project setup page (REMEMBER: check the write access box so that you are able to push your commits).
- Once that is done, I would advise to go back to your profile where you can edit your project details

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8760747e-3ec5-4076-b859-e2ab61082c91)

- Click on edit and add the project description as well as the project subdirectory. This will be useful when initialising the project on the cloud IDE first.

### 4. Initialising dbt project

- This process is essential as it creates the foundational file structure for the project.
- To complete this step now that we have done the basic project setup (i.e. connection BigQuery and Github) we can now proceed to our cloud IDE.
- To do so, we can simply navigate to `Develop` on the left navigation panel and select Cloud IDE and this should set up our environment (which may take a couple of minutes to set up)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c2a9aa0-f0d9-4d06-b6ab-bff431ba03f9)

- Once in, you should see something like the following:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fad92db-2c1a-484b-b65e-50481c8b39d0)

- Now click on `Initialize dbt project` and this should create the folders that you need 

### 5. Configure the dbt Cloud CLI

- Now that we have initialised the dbt project, we can proceed to configure our Cloud CLI so that we can work on the dbt project locally.
- Again on our left navigation panel, click on Develop >> Configure Cloud CLI

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1a07a7f-b4bd-49e2-a385-bb9d34aa0974)

- It should take you to the following page, select Linux on Step 1 since the OS on our VM instance on GCP is Debian GNU/Linux (you can run the command `cat /etc/os-release` to find out your OS of your VM) which is a Linux based system. This should show you the steps for configuration.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf83b5bb-e78e-4f3a-a1f2-997f567e5b3a)

- For Step 1: Install, go to the dbt Github page to download the latest Linux release (you can run the command `wget https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-cli/releases/download/v0.38.23/dbt_0.38.23_linux_amd64.tar.gz` on your VM terminal)
- The reason for choosing that linux release is because my VM is running Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) with an x86_64 (amd64) architecture.
- Run the following command to unpack the compressed file (lets assume you ran the previous command in your home directory:
```bash
tar -xf dbt_0.29.9_linux_amd64.tar.gz
./dbt --version
```

- Once done, it is advised to create a `.dbt/` hidden folder in your home directory and move the extracted `dbt-cloud-cli` executable to the hidden folder, and create a PATH variable for this executable so as to be able to run dbt program for anywhere (especially useful when you have multiple dbt projects), as follows:
1. `nano ~/.bashrc`
2.  At bottom of page, write:
```bash
export DBT_HOME=~/.dbt/dbt
export PATH=$PATH:$DBT_HOME
```
3. Write out and then run `source ~/.bashrc`

- Run `dbt —version` to verify installation
- For step 2: Configure cloud authentication, we need to download the configuration file to our local downloads folder and then copy it into our instance. My preferred way is to run the following command on our LOCAL terminal (and not the instance command line):
```bash
gcloud compute scp ~/Downloads/dbt_cloud.yml peter@de-zoomcamp:~/.dbt/
```
> [!NOTE]
> I have used the command that I used to highlight the importance of mentioning the user@instance_name as there may be a possibility of having multiple users on the instance. So pick the one where your project repo is in.

- So now for Step 3 : Link your local project to a dbt Cloud project, we need to add the project id provided on the page onto our dbt_projects.yml file as follows:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c0f2753-a20b-4b6e-b857-1018f5ac3af5)

- Step 4: Invoke a dbt command, now all you have to do is to run the command `dbt compile` to compile your project and validate models and tests (but essentially its just to see if the connection to the dbt cloud project from your local project works).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4135ff92-e6ee-41d5-af11-0a3d8aa3aeb9)

## dbt Core

_[Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HmL63e-vRs&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=37)_

Installing dbt Core locally can be done following the steps in [the official docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/install/overview). More instructions are also available [in this link](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/week_4_analytics_engineering/docker_setup).

Starting a dbt project with dbt Core involves creating a `profiles.yml` file manually before running `dbt init`. Check the Video source for more info.

# Developing with dbt

RECAP: dbt sits on top of our platform (BigQuery or Postgres depending on how you are proceding with the course).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9022b57d-fa8c-4d11-a1e3-73214e092ae7)

- `Raw Data` : Truth data coming from our source (green and orange data)
- `Develop` as well as `test & documentation`, both layers will be done on a sandbox
- `Deploy` will be pushing our transformed data into production from a development environment.

## Anatomy of a dbt model

We will be taking a modular data modelling approach, this simply means breaking down complex transformations into smaller, reusable, and logically organized models. This method helps to improve maintainability, scalability, and collaboration across teams.

This method takes a layered approach where in each layer you have `.sql` scripts called `models` in dbt's lingo to perform the necessary transformations. For example, in a typical project you can have maybe three layers:
- `staging`: Clean and standardise raw data
- `intermediate`: Implement business logic and combina data sources
- `mart`: Create final datasets ready for reporting

> [!NOTE]
> Its good practice to start off your model name with say `stg` for a staging .sql script

bt models are mostly written in SQL (remember that a dbt model is essentially a `SELECT` query) but they also make use of the [Jinja templating language](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) for templates. We already covered the basics of Jinja templates in [lesson 2](https://github.com/peterchettiar/DEngZoomCamp_2025/tree/main/Module-2-workflow-orchestration#airflow-and-dag-tips-and-tricks).

Here's an example dbt model:

```sql
{{
    config(materialized='table')
}}

SELECT *
FROM staging.source_table
WHERE record_state = 'ACTIVE'
```

* In the Jinja statement defined within the `{{ }}` block we call the [`config()` function](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/config). The `config` variable exists to handle end-user configuration for custom materialisation (i.e. The exact DDL language that dbt will use after compiling model that will create the model's equivalent in the data warehouse).
    * More info about Jinja macros for dbt [in this link](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/jinja-macros).
* We commonly use the `config()` function at the beginning of a model to define a ***materialization strategy***: a strategy for persisting dbt models in a warehouse.
    * The `table` strategy means that the model will be rebuilt as a table on each run.
    * We could use a `view` strategy instead, which would rebuild the model on each run as a SQL view.
    * The `incremental` strategy is essentially a `table` strategy but it allows us to add or update records incrementally rather than rebuilding the complete table on each run.
    * The `ephemeral` strategy creates a _[Common Table Expression](https://www.essentialsql.com/introduction-common-table-expressions-ctes/)_ (CTE).
    * You can learn more about materialization strategies with dbt [in this link](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/materializations). Besides the 4 common `table`, `view`, `incremental` and `ephemeral` strategies, custom strategies can be defined for advanced cases.

dbt will compile this code into the following SQL query:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_schema.my_model AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM staging.source_table
    WHERE record_state = 'ACTIVE'
)
```

After the code is compiled, dbt will run the compiled code in the Data Warehouse.

Additional model properties are stored in YAML files. Traditionally, these files were named `schema.yml` but later versions of dbt do not enforce this as it could lead to confusion.

### Quick tip on recognising jinja templates
- Expressions `{{ ... }}`: Expressions are used when you want to output a string. You can use expressions to reference varaibles and call macros.
- Statements `{% ... %}`: Statments don't output a string. They are used for control flow, for example, to set up `for` loops and `if` statements, to set or modify variables, or to define macros.
- Comments `{# ... #}`: Jinja comments are used to prenvent the text within the comment from executing or outputing a string. Don't use `--` for comment.

## The FROM clause: Sources and Seeds

The `FROM` clause within a `SELECT` statement defines the _sources_ of the data to be used. As such the following two are what we can select from a `FROM` clause:
  
### 1. Sources

- Sources can be seen as a map to guide dbt to the location of the data that was loaded to our data warehouse through a `{{ source() }}` function used in our models
- These configurations are typically declared in a `source.yml` file usually found in the models folder
- Used with the `source` macro that will resolve the name to the right schema plus build the dependencies automatically
- Additionally, we can define "source freshness" to each source so that we can check whether a source is "fresh" or "stale", which can be useful to check whether our data pipelines are working properly
- More info about sources in this [link](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/using-sources)
- An example of how a `source.yml` might look for our project:
```yaml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: nyc_tlc_data
    database: ny-rides-peter-415106  
    schema: nyc_tlc_data  
    tables:
      - name: greentaxi_trips
      - name: yellowtaxi_trips
        freshness:
          error_after: {count: 6, period: hour}
```
> [!NOTE]
> By default, `schema` will be the same as `name`. Add `schema` only if you want to use a source name that differs from the existing schema.
- And you might `select` from source using `{{ source() }} function` as follows:
```sql
select
  ...

from {{ source('nyc_tlc_data', 'greentaxi_trips') }}

left join {{ source('nyc_tlc_data', 'yellowtaxi_trips') }} using (VendorID)
```

> [!NOTE]
> `{{ source() }} function` and `source` macro are the same thing, it is a built in macro in itself and hence the terms function and macro in relation to `source` can and will be used interchangably in these notes.

### 2. Seeds

- Seeds are `CSV` files in the dbt project (typically in the `seeds` directory), that dbt can load into the data warehouse using the `dbt seed -s file_name` command.
- Because these CSV files are located in our dbt repository, they are version controlled and code reviewable. Seeds are best suited to static data which changes infrequently.
- Equivalent to a `cp` command
- Refer to the seed in your model with the `ref()` function. The macro can be used in referencing a `model`, `seed` as well as `snapshot`.
> [!NOTE]
> If you update the content of a seed, running `dbt seed` will append the updated values to the table rather than substituing them. Running `dbt seed --full-refresh` instead will drop the old table and create a new one.

At this juncture, you might be wondering as to what the difference between `ref` and the `source` macros is, considering that they both servce very similar functions with respect to referencing datasets. Well they serve very distinct purposes as well as are used in different contexts. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

## Difference Between `ref` and `source` Macros in dbt

| **Aspect**             | **`ref` Macro**                                       | **`source` Macro**                                    |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**             | References **models** within the dbt project.        | References **raw source tables** outside the dbt project. |
| **Use Case**            | Used to reference a **dbt model** by its name, enabling dependency management and dynamic schema resolution. | Used to reference tables from external **source systems** (e.g., raw data in a database). |
| **Definition Location** | Models are created and maintained within the dbt project as `.sql` files. | Sources are defined in YAML files under the `sources` key. |
| **Syntax**              | `{{ ref('model_name') }}`                            | `{{ source('source_name', 'table_name') }}`          |
| **Dependency Management** | Automatically builds model dependencies and execution order. | Does not create dependencies but tracks the lineage of source data. |
| **Schema Resolution**   | Resolves dynamically based on the project configuration and environments. | Resolves based on the schema and table defined in the `sources` YAML file. |
| **Lineage Visibility**  | Shows relationships between dbt models in the DAG.   | Shows the raw data as an entry point in the DAG.      |
| **Testing**             | Tests can be applied via YAML for the referenced model. | Tests like freshness, schema, and data integrity can be applied to the source. |
| **Example Usage**       | Referencing a dbt model:                              | Referencing raw data:                                |
|                         | ```sql                                               | ```sql                                               |
|                         | select *                                             | select *                                             |
|                         | from {{ ref('stg_orders') }}                         | from {{ source('ecommerce', 'orders') }}            |
|                         | ```                                                  | ```                                                  |

For more information on the `ref()` function,  check out this [link](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref).

## Defining a source and creating a model

We will now create our first model.

We will begin by creating a new folder called `staging` under our `models` folder. In the `staging` folder is where we would hold our models (`.sql` scripts) that clean and standardises raw data. This is usually the first layer of the transformation pipeline, example transformations to name a few in this step includes:
1. Add uniform naming
2. Type casting
3. Deduplication

As such, a typical layer structure might look like the following:
| **Layer**       | **Description**                                                                                           | **Examples**                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Source**      | Represents the raw data ingested from external systems or databases.                                       | Raw tables from CRM, ERP, APIs, etc. |
| **Staging**     | Prepares raw data by cleaning, standardizing, and transforming it for further use.                        | Removing duplicates, data type casts |
| **Intermediate**| Models that handle business logic or calculations, serving as a foundation for analytics.                 | Aggregations, calculations, joins    |
| **Presentation**| Final models optimized for business users, dashboards, or reporting tools.                                | Fact and dimension tables            |
| **Analytics**   | Advanced analytics, metrics, or KPIs built on top of the presentation layer.                              | Key metrics, trend analysis          |

First thing we need to do after initialising our project is to change the default `name` and `models` fields in the `dbt_project.yml` file to the name of our project. This helps dbt distinguish from other projects as well as the existence of the `dbt_project.yml` file shows dbt that the directory is a dbt project. Next, in our `staging` folder we had just created, we create a `schema.yml` file (this is the same as `sources.yml` as mentioned in the previous section).

In the `schema.yml` file, we define our ***sources*** in the `schema.yml` model properties file. The stucture should be as follows:
```yaml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: staging
  # For bigquery
    database: ny-rides-peter-415106
    schema: nyc_tlc_data

    tables:
      - name: greentaxi_trips
      - name: yellowtaxi_trips
```

And if you're using the dbt cloud IDE, above the table name a prompt called `Generate model` should appear. If you click on that, it will create a model based off the name of the table as well as the layer in which the model is placed (in our case `staging`). The default `.sql` model should look like this:
```sql
with 

source as (

    select * from {{ source('staging', 'greentaxi_trips') }}

),

renamed as (

    select
        *
    from source

)

select * from renamed
```

* This query will create a ***view*** in the `staging` dataset/schema in our database.
* We make use of the `source()` function to access the green taxi data table, which is defined inside the `schema.yml` file.
* If you would like to create a table instead, insert the following statement at the start of your `.sql` script - 
`{{ config(materialized='table') }}`.

> [!NOTE]
> Unless specified otherwise in the model, the default output would be a view in bigquery

The advantage of having the properties in a separate file is that we can easily modify the `schema.yml` file to change the database details and write to different databases without having to modify our `sgt_green_tripdata.sql` file.

You may know run the model with the `dbt run` or `dbt build` command, either locally or from dbt Cloud.

Another point to note the difference between `dbt run` and `dbt build` which are quite similar but the following are the comparison of the two:
| **Aspect**                  | **`dbt build`**                                                                 | **`dbt run`**                                         |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                 | Executes a full workflow including building models, testing, and validation.    | Executes only the transformation models (SQL files). |
| **Included Actions**        | - Runs models. <br> - Runs tests (generic and bespoke). <br> - Seeds and snapshots. | - Runs only the transformation models.               |
| **Scope**                   | Covers the entire pipeline to ensure data is transformed, tested, and validated. | Focuses solely on building (transforming) models.    |
| **Dependencies**            | Resolves dependencies and runs tests after building models.                     | Resolves dependencies but doesn’t test or validate.  |
| **Command Example**         | `dbt build`                                                                      | `dbt run`                                            |
| **When to Use**             | Before deploying a production pipeline or validating end-to-end workflows.      | For quick testing or debugging of transformation models. |

## Macros

***Macros*** are pieces of code in Jinja that can be reused, similar to functions in other languages.

dbt already includes a series of macros like `config()`, `source()` and `ref()`, but custom macros can also be defined.

Macros allow us to add features to SQL that aren't otherwise available, such as:
* Use control structures such as `if` statements or `for` loops.
* Use environment variables in our dbt project for production.
* Operate on the results of one query to generate another query.
* Abstract snippets of SQL into reusable macros.

Macros are defined in separate `.sql` files which are typically stored in a `macros` directory.

There are 3 kinds of Jinja _delimiters_:
* `{% ... %}` for ***statements*** (control blocks, macro definitions)
* `{{ ... }}` for ***expressions*** (literals, math, comparisons, logic, macro calls...)
* `{# ... #}` for comments.

Here's a macro definition example:

```sql
{# This macro returns the description of the payment_type #}

{% macro get_payment_type_description(payment_type) %}

    case {{ payment_type }}
        when 1 then 'Credit card'
        when 2 then 'Cash'
        when 3 then 'No charge'
        when 4 then 'Dispute'
        when 5 then 'Unknown'
        when 6 then 'Voided trip'
    end

{% endmacro %}
```
* The `macro` keyword states that the line is a macro definition. It includes the name of the macro as well as the parameters.
* The code of the macro itself goes between 2 statement delimiters. The second statement delimiter contains an `endmacro` keyword.
* In the code, we can access the macro parameters using expression delimiters.
* The macro returns the ***code*** we've defined rather than a specific value.

Here's how we use the macro:
```sql
select
    {{ get_payment_type_description('payment-type') }} as payment_type_description,
    congestion_surcharge::double precision
from {{ source('staging','greentaxi_trips') }}
where vendorid is not null
```
* We pass a `payment-type` variable which may be an integer from 1 to 6.

And this is what it would compile to:
```sql
select
    case payment_type
        when 1 then 'Credit card'
        when 2 then 'Cash'
        when 3 then 'No charge'
        when 4 then 'Dispute'
        when 5 then 'Unknown'
        when 6 then 'Voided trip'
    end as payment_type_description,
    congestion_surcharge::double precision
from {{ source('staging','greentaxi_trips') }}
where vendorid is not null
```
* The macro is replaced by the code contained within the macro definition as well as any variables that we may have passed to the macro parameters.

## Packages

Macros can be exported to ***packages***, similarly to how classes and functions can be exported to libraries in other languages. Packages contain standalone dbt projects with models and macros that tackle a specific problem area.

When you add a package to your project, the package's models and macros become part of your own project. A list of useful packages can be found in the [dbt package hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/).

To use a package, you must first create a `packages.yml` file in the root of your work directory. Here's an example:
```yaml
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
    version: 1.3.0
```
After declaring your packages, and clicking on `save` on the dbt cloud IDE, the packages should appear as `dbt packages` in your project folder. But if this does not happen, you need to install them by running the `dbt deps` command either locally or on dbt Cloud.

You may access macros inside a package in a similar way to how Python access class methods:
```sql
select
    {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['vendorid', 'lpep_pickup_datetime']) }} as tripid,
    cast(vendorid as integer) as vendorid,
    -- ...
```
* The `surrogate_key()` macro generates a hashed [surrogate key](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/surrogate-key-in-dbms/) with the specified fields in the arguments.

Let's breakdown the compiled output of our `surrogate_key` in our model:
```sql
select
    to_hex(md5(cast(coalesce(cast(vendorid as string), '_dbt_utils_surrogate_key_null_') || '-' || coalesce(cast(lpep_pickup_datetime as string), '_dbt_utils_surrogate_key_null_') as string))) as tripid,
    vendorid
    -- ...
```

- both our inputs, `vendorid` and `lpep_pickup_datetime` are casted as string - e.g. `cast(vendorid as string)`
- then we use the `coalesce` statement to deal with the null values by replacing it with `_dbt_utils_surrogate_key_null_`, and cast the output as a string as well - e.g. `cast(coalesce(cast(vendorid as string), '_dbt_utils_surrogate_key_null_'))`
- next we concatenate the ouputs of both keys and then cast it as a string again - e.g. `cast((...) || '-' || (...) as string)`
- generate a 128-bit hash using the MD5 algorithm on the concatenated string - `md5(...)`
- convert the MD5 hash into a human-readable hexadecimal string - `to_hex(...)`
- assign the resulting value the alias `tripid`

In the end, after a few more adjustments to our model, it should look something like [this](https://github.com/peterchettiar/DEngZoomCamp_2025/blob/dbt_cloud/Module-4-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/models/staging/stg_greentaxi_trips.sql). Also, with the similar steps done so far, our `stg_yellowtaxi_trips` model should the same as for `stg_greentaxi_trips`. Check out the `.sql` file [here](https://github.com/peterchettiar/DEngZoomCamp_2025/blob/dbt_cloud/Module-4-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/models/staging/stg_yellowtaxi_trips.sql).

> [!TIP]
> A quick way of applying a macro in a jinja template form in your model would be to type `__` (two underscores) followed by the name of the macro, and when you press enter the template should appear. For example, if I type `__config` and press the `Enter` key, then `{{ config(materialised='view') }}` should appear.

## Variables

In dbt, `variables` are a way to parameterize your SQL queries and configurations, making your dbt projects more dynamic and reusable. Variables allow you to pass values into your models, macros, and other configurations without hardcoding them, which is especially useful for environments, configurations, or values that might change.

`variables` can be scoped globally through `dbt_projects.yml` file or locally within a specific model or configuration, and they can be set via:
1. `dbt_projects.yml`
```yml
vars:
  payment_type_values: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```
2. command line
```bash
dbt run --vars '{"my_variable": "custom_value"}'
```
For exmple, we can limit the number of records that is created on our dbt project dataset development table (i.e. `stg_greentaxi_trips` - which is actually a view and not a table) by setting the condition of our variable in our `stg_greentaxi_trips.sql` model as follows:
```sql
{% if var('is_test_run', default=true) %}

    limit 100

{% endif %}
```

What the SQL query above actually does is that the records created in our view when we run the model will be limited to the first 100 records (i.e. what you end up seeing in bigquery would be a view with just 100 records) unless specified as false. So if we change the `default` value, then all the records will be loaded to our table. The following build command would load all records:
```bash
dbt run --model stg_greentaxi_trips --vars '{"is_test_run": false}'
```
> [!TIP]
> This is a particularyly useful variable as with the default value we will be able to develop with lesser records being loaded into bigquery, which makes it cheaper and faster. And when we are done with development we can simply change the default value to `false` and load all the records into production environment. The formal name for this is `dev limit`.

## Referencing older models in new models

Below is an image of our workflow to be compared with where we are at in our lineage in dbt cloud.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac78f1b5-22ad-4c97-81c7-fc0b306a0579)

Now that we have completed our staging layer, its time to move on to the next stage which is the core of the lesson which is data modelling - defining the `fact` table and `dim` table.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9917a75-15cc-46ed-b81e-70f075cac447)

So the first thing we need to do is to create a subfolder called `core` in our `models` folder in our project folder, to hold our fact and dimendional model. In the `core` folder, we can proceed to create the `dim_zones.sql` model first. But before that, we need to do a couple of things  for the dimensional table before we tackle the fact table, as follows:

1. Create our raw dimensional table in the `seeds` folder of our project. There are other ways of doing so but I'm just going to copy the raw data from the course repository [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/refs/heads/main/04-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/seeds/taxi_zone_lookup.csv), and just `create new file` in our `seeds` folder as `taxi_zone_lookup.csv`. Final output should look something like this on dbt cloud. After which, you run the `dbt build --select taxi_zone_lookup` command to load the the referenc file as a table into bigquery.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0f9bf42-76c7-4315-8782-4c03840a0fae)

2. Next we write the following query into our `dim_zones.sql` model.
```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='view'
    )
}}

select
    locationid,
    borough,
    zone,
    replace(service_zone, 'Boro', 'Green')
from {{ ref("taxi_zone_lookup") }}
```

3. Now to create a `fact_trips.sql` model in our `core` folder. The query of the model is as follows:
```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='table'
    )
}}

with green_tripdata as (
    select *, 
        'Green' as service_type
    from {{ ref('stg_greentaxi_trips') }}
), 
yellow_tripdata as (
    select *, 
        'Yellow' as service_type
    from {{ ref('stg_yellowtaxi_trips') }}
), 
trips_unioned as (
    select * from green_tripdata
    union all 
    select * from yellow_tripdata
), 
dim_zones as (
    select * from {{ ref('dim_zones') }}
    where borough != 'Unknown'
)

select trips_unioned.tripid, 
    trips_unioned.vendorid, 
    trips_unioned.service_type,
    trips_unioned.ratecodeid, 
    trips_unioned.pickup_locationid, 
    pickup_zone.borough as pickup_borough, 
    pickup_zone.zone as pickup_zone, 
    trips_unioned.dropoff_locationid,
    dropoff_zone.borough as dropoff_borough, 
    dropoff_zone.zone as dropoff_zone,  
    trips_unioned.pickup_datetime, 
    trips_unioned.dropoff_datetime, 
    trips_unioned.store_and_fwd_flag, 
    trips_unioned.passenger_count, 
    trips_unioned.trip_distance, 
    trips_unioned.trip_type, 
    trips_unioned.fare_amount, 
    trips_unioned.extra, 
    trips_unioned.mta_tax, 
    trips_unioned.tip_amount, 
    trips_unioned.tolls_amount, 
    trips_unioned.ehail_fee, 
    trips_unioned.improvement_surcharge, 
    trips_unioned.total_amount, 
    trips_unioned.payment_type, 
    trips_unioned.payment_type_description
from trips_unioned
inner join dim_zones as pickup_zone
on trips_unioned.pickup_locationid = pickup_zone.locationid
inner join dim_zones as dropoff_zone
on trips_unioned.dropoff_locationid = dropoff_zone.locationid
```

> [!NOTE]
> It is worth pointing out that after you run the build command (or `dbt seed`) for your `.csv` files in the seed folder, the data should be loaded as a table in the dbt dataset in `bigquery`. Without this step, the data would not be loaded while running your dbt model for the dimensional data as the `ref()` macro only references to the corresponding table in `bigquery` and not directly from the `.csv` file in the `seeds` folder.

4. Lastly, let's build our model by running the `dbt build --select +fact_trips+` - this command basically builds our entire DAG (i.e. basically our workflow based on the lineage that you see in dbt cloud). Pretty much most of the command must be familiar to you with the exception of the argument provided to the `--select` flag (i.e. `+fact_trips+`. Essentially, you are telling dbt to build all the nodes that are upstream and downstream of `fact_trips`, including itself. `upstream` or `Parent` nodes are dependancies that `fact_trips` depends on, like `stg_greentaxi_trips` or `staging.greentaxi_trips`. These models neeed to be built first before `fact_trips`. Naturally, you can tell by now that there aren't any `child` nodes because there are no models after `fact_trips` in the `downstream`. Nonetheless, the extra `+` was included by the course instructor.

> [!TIP]
> If you come across the `Access Denied: BigQuery BigQuery: Permission denied while globbing file pattern.` error when your run your dbt command for build `fact_trips`, chances are your service account does not have the right permissions to access your `Google Cloud Storage` bucket. To fix this, simply go to your bucket details page on your `Google Cloud Storage` via the console. Click on the `PERMISSIONS` tab, and should able to see a `GRANT ACCESS` button. Click on it and add your dbt service account as principle as well as selecting `Storage Object Viewer` under roles. This should fix the problem!

5. It should be noted that the command we ran `dbt build --select +fact_trips+` includes the limit that we had set in our staging models. This is suitable for developement but if we want to build our workflow for production without the limitation, then we simply include the `--vars` flag - `dbt build --select +fact_trips+ --vars '{'is_test_run': false}'`

# Testing and documenting dbt models

Testing and documenting are not required steps to successfully run models, but they are expected in any professional setting.

## Testing

Data tests are assertions you make about your models and other resources in your dbt project (e.g. sources, seeds and snapshots). This allows you to test the integrity of the SQL in each model. Out of the box, you can test whether a specified column in a model contains only `non-null`, `unique`, `accepted_values` and `relationships` (i.e. values that have a corresponding value in another model). Data tests are essentially SQL quries, more specifcally they are `SELECT` statements that seek to grab "failing" records, ones that disprove your assertions (i.e. after you define your data test, dbt will compile the data test into SQL query where it will return records that do not meet your validation criteria).
 
So this begs the question as to how we actually define the data tests in dbt. There are two approaches to achieve this:
1. A `singular` data test
2. A `generic` data test

### Singular data tests

These type of tests are called "singular" as they are one-off assertions usable for a single purpose. They are defined as a `,sql` file typically in the `tests` directory of your dbt project. They can be executed using the `dbt test` command. An example of such a test is as follows:
```sql
-- Refunds have a negative amount, so the total amount should always be >= 0.
-- Therefore return records where total_amount < 0 to make the test fail.
select
    order_id,
    sum(amount) as total_amount
from {{ ref('fct_payments') }}
group by 1
having total_amount < 0
```
Essentially, we are testing to see if there are any refund records in the `fct_payments` table.

> [!NOTE]
> The `.sql` file should be in the tests folder and if you want to include a decsription to a singular test, then this should be defined in a `.yml` file in the same `tests` directory.
> Also omit semi-colons at the end of the SQL statment in your singular test files as they may cause your test to fail.
> You can use jinja (`ref` and `source`) in the test definition, just like you can when creating models.

### Generic data tests

Singular data tests are so easy that you may find yourself writing the same basic structure repeatedly, only changing the name of a column or model. By that point, the test isn't so singular! In that case, generic data tests are recommended.

Generic tests are defined in a `tests` block as a property on any existing model (source, seed, or snapshot) `.yml` file. An example as follows:
```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: orders
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: status
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['placed', 'shipped', 'completed', 'returned']
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - relationships:
              to: ref('customers')
              field: id
```

After defining the generic data tests in the `.yml` file, dbt will process the arguments provided into a parametrized query. For example, if we take take the `not_null` test on the `order_id` column of the `order` model, dbt will template the model and column name into its built-in parameterized `not_null` query as follows:
```sql
{% test not_null(model, column_name) %}

    select *
    from {{ model }}
    where {{ column_name }} is null

{% endtest %}
```

After which, behnd the scenes, dbt constructs a `select` query for each data test, using the parametrized query from the generic test block. These queries return the rows where your assertion is not true; if the test returns zero rows, your assertion passes.

> [!TIP]
> Sometimes we have multiple tests to be run on many fields, and this can be a cumbersome process especially when defining these generic tests in a `.yml` file. Hence, it would be advised to use the `codegen` package from dbt (steps for using this package is similar to [dbt_utils](https://github.com/peterchettiar/DEngZoomCamp_2025/tree/dbt_cloud/Module-4-analytics-engineering#packages)), using the `generate_model_yaml` macro.

Steps for using `generate_model_yaml` macro:
1. Create a new file and copy the helper function below to a new file in your project directory.
```sql
{% set models_to_generate = codegen.get_models(directory='marts', prefix='fct_') %}
{{ codegen.generate_model_yaml(
    model_names = models_to_generate
) }}
```
2. Next, we want to change the directory as well as the prefix (optional). Let's say `staging` directory and `stg_` as prefix for this example.
3. Select the entire query and click on `compile selection` in the `dbt cloud IDE`. This should generate the `name`, `data_type` and `description` of each column for each model in the specified model directory as well as prefix.
4. Copy the output and paste it in the `schema.yml` file (can be placed after `sources`, starting with `model`).
5. Amend the tests as you see fit.

> [!NOTE]
> When setting tests the default test inputs are considered strings. For example, if we apply an `accepted_values` test on an integer column, naturally the input values for the test should also be `int64`. In order to make sure that the compiled query is also reflecting the same datatype, we need to add an additional condition to our test, `quote=false`.

Now to repeat the same steps for our `core` models. Another `core` model called [`dm_monthly_zone_revenue.sql`](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/04-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/models/core/dm_monthly_zone_revenue.sql) was added, code was taken from course repository. Now, we can run the same step with `core` as directory and no prefix argument given:
```sql
{% set models_to_generate = codegen.get_models(directory='marts', prefix='fct_') %}
{{ codegen.generate_model_yaml(
    model_names = models_to_generate
) }}
```

Make sure to copy the compiled output into a seperate `schema.yml` for the `core` models. After which, you can run the `dbt build` command and dbt will compile the models as well as their respective validation tests as follows:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a004e231-e13a-406f-8be4-b5553ad20e22)

Based on the above, you can see the approach dbt takes to compile the models and run the test is in line with the lineage graph (as dbt moves from left to right layers in the DAG).

## Documentation

dbt provides a way to generate documentation for your dbt project. The documentation for your project includes:
- **Information about the project**: including model code, a DAG of your project, any tests you've added to a column, and more.
- **Information about your data warehouse**: including column types, and table sizes. This information is generated by running queries against the information schema.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> dbt also provides a way to add descriptions to models, columns, sources, and more, to further enhance your documentation.

The default documentation experience in dbt cloud is in `dbt explorer` that is available to Team or Enterprise plans. dbt explorer allows your view your project's resources (such as models, tests, metrics), its metadata, and their lineage to gain a better understanding of its latest production state. For dbt cloud developer and dbt core users (like ourselves) we can use `dbt docs`, which generates basic documentation, but doesn't offer the same speed, metadata, or visibility as dbt explorer.

Generate documentation for your project by following these steps:
1. Run `dbt docs generate` - this command tells dbt to compile relevant information about your project and warehouse into `manifest.json` and `catalog.json` files, respectively.
2. Ensure you've created the models with `dbt run` to view the documentation for all documentation, not just those described in your project.
3. Run `dbt doc serve` if you're deploying locally to use these `.json` files to populate a local website.

Once you've filled in the description fields in your `schema.yml` files for `core` and `staging`, run the `dbt docs gnerate command` in dbt cloud. After dbt gathers the information it needs it will autogenerate the documentation for your project, click on the button shown below and this should take you to your documentation server as a website:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a898dd6e-ff5d-4f6b-820f-717e7a435227)

Once in your project documentation page, you would be able to see the descriptions you've added in your `.yml` on the html page as follows:

# Deployment of a dbt project

_Video sources: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjf6yZNGX8I&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=40)_, [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs9Od1pcrzM&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=41)

## Deployment basics

If you remember from the [beginning of this lesson](#what-is-dbt), the goal of dbt is to introduce good software engineering practices by defining a ***deployment workflow***.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da1d2bb5-fc03-4075-8dbc-9ab121a84739)

So far we've seen the `Develop` and `Test And Document` stages of the workflow. We will now cover _deployment_.

What is deployment?
- _Deployment_ is the process of running the models we created in our development environment in a production environment
- Development and later deployment allows us to continue building our models and testing them without without affecting our production environemnt
- A deployment environment will normally have a different schema in our data warehouse and ideally a different user
- A development - deployment workflow will be something like:
  - Develop in a user branch
  - Open a PR to merge into the main branch (ideally someone should review and approve, but this can be automated too)
  - Merge the branch to the main branch
  - Run the new models in production environment using the main branch
  - Schedule the models
 
Running a dbt project in production - dbt projects are usually deployed in the form of ***jobs***:
* A ***job*** is a collection of _commands_ such as `build` or `test`. A job may contain one or more commands.
* Jobs can be triggered manually or on schedule.
    * dbt Cloud has a scheduler which can run jobs for us, but other tools such as Airflow or cron can be used as well.
* Each job will keep a log of the runs over time, and each run will keep the logs for each command.
* A job may also be used to generate documentation, which may be viewed under the run information.
* If the `dbt source freshness` command was run, the results can also be viewed at the end of a job.

## Continuous Integration

Another good software engineering practice that dbt enables is ***Continuous Integration*** (CI): the practice of regularly merging development branches into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. The goal of CI is to reduce adding bugs to the production code and maintain a more stable project.

CI is built on jobs: a CI job will do things such as build, test, etc. We can define CI jobs which can then be triggered under certain circunstances to enable CI.

dbt makes use of GitHub/GitLab's Pull Requests to enable CI via [webhooks](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Webhook). When a PR is ready to be merged, a webhook is received in dbt Cloud that will enqueue a new run of a CI job. This run will usually be against a temporary schema that has been created explicitly for the PR. If the job finishes successfully, the PR can be merged into the main branch, but if it fails the merge will not happen.

CI jobs can also be scheduled with the dbt Cloud scheduler, Airflow, cron and a number of additional tools.

## Deployment using dbt Cloud

In dbt Cloud, you might have noticed that after the first commit, the `main` branch becomes read-only and forces us to create a new branch if we want to keep developing. dbt Cloud does this to enforce us to open PRs for CI purposes rather than allowing merging to `main` straight away.

In order to properly establish a deployment workflow, we must define ***environments*** within dbt Cloud. In the sidebar, click on _Deploy_ followed by _Environments_.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97251401-696d-40cd-8c3f-b53b5ddc347f)

On the landing page, you will see that a default _Development_ environment is already generated, which is the one we've been using so far. Next we click on `create environment` to create our production environment.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9db0f28-d127-4496-8821-f7b14b6b2e0c)

We will create a new _Production_ environment of type _Deployment_ using the latest stable dbt version. By default, the environment will use the `main` branch of the repo but you may change it for more complex workflows. If you used the JSON credentials when setting up dbt Cloud then most of the deployment credentials should already be set up except for the dataset. For this example, we will use the `production` dataset (make sure that the `production` dataset/schema exists in your BigQuery project).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/557cc1f4-b3d2-4343-90e0-ffe243e50dc8)

Next, once we've created the `Production` environment we can create a new job. Click on `Create job` in the production environment page and click on `Deploy job`. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cef000b2-b6f9-4128-b5de-9bca326e3ac3)

Then fill out the details in the landing page as follows:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/422869af-d622-4f53-a44a-6180f398389c)

The dbt Cloud scheduler is available in the _Jobs_ menu in the sidebar. We will create a new job with name `Nightly` using the _Production_ environment, we will check the _Generate docs_ checkbox as well as the _Run source freshness_. Add the following commands:

1. `dbt build`

In the _Schedule_ tab at the bottom we will check the _Run on schedule_ checkbox, with a timing of _Specific hours_ and _12_ (we do not receive data on weekends, hence we can uncheck Saturday and Sunday under _Days of the week_. Save the job. You will be shown the job's run history screen which contains a _Run now_ buttom that allows us to trigger the job manually; do so to check that the job runs successfully.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5987858d-6010-4386-af47-2a2556b31be8)

You can access the run and check the current state of it as well as the logs. After the run is finished, you will see a _View Documentation_ button at the top; clicking on it will open a new browser window/tab with the generated docs.

Under _Account settings_ > _Projects_, you may edit the project in order to modify the _Documentation_ field under _Artifacts_; you should see a drop down menu which should contain the job we created which generates the docs. After saving the changes and reloading the dbt Cloud website, you should now have a _Documentation_ section in the sidebar.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When running a job in the dbt production environment, the execution log will display the branch and commit hash of the code repository it is using. By default, jobs typically run code from the `main` branch. Therefore, it's essential to create a **pull request** to merge changes from a feature branch into the `main` branch, ensuring that the latest updates are included in production. Make sure this is done so before running/scheduling job.
> ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42cf9270-b488-4adf-a813-d8df24d8e022)

> [!NOTE]
> Please be reminded that we used the `dbt build` command when defining the job's **execution settings**, and this only gives us part of the data due to our limit restriction implemented for development. So if we want the full data deployed for production, we should use the `dbt build --select +fact_trips+ --vars '{'is_test_run': false}'` instead to remove the limitation on our entire workflow.

## Deployment using dbt Core (local)

In dbt Core, environments are defined in the `profiles.yml` file. Assuming you've defined a ***target*** (an environment) called `prod`, you may build your project agains it using the `dbt build -t prod` command.

You may learn more about how to set up the `profiles.yml` file [in this link](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile).
